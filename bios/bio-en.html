      <h1>Patrick Billy – Official Biography</h1>

      <p>
        Patrick Billy is a French designer of digital accessibility tools, inclusive interfaces,
        and applied AI solutions for real-world environments. His work bridges technology and
        human reality: disability, constrained environments, low-tech contexts and complex
        social situations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Coming from a background in graphic design, training and field-oriented problem solving,
        Patrick has learned how to build solutions that are <strong>simple, robust and accessible</strong>.
        He is the founder of <strong>Élan pour Tous</strong>, a social initiative that creates tools
        aimed at supporting vulnerable users, families, teachers and organizations.
      </p>

      <p>
        He is also the creator of <strong>Mini-WTD</strong> (Work-Test-Demo), a lightweight simulator
        used to analyse job tasks, assess workplace constraints and propose concrete accommodations.
        Mini-WTD is intentionally designed to work in environments with limited digital infrastructure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Patrick works between France and Madagascar, with a strong sensitivity for contexts where
        digital tools must adapt to human reality, not the other way around. His approach combines:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Digital accessibility (RGAA / WCAG)</li>
        <li>Inclusive & low-tech UX design</li>
        <li>Applied AI for explanation, guidance and simplification</li>
        <li>Offline and constrained-environment tools (USB, intranet)</li>
        <li>Field analysis, job simulation and workplace adaptation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        His work is guided by a clear philosophy:
        <em>technology must reduce complexity, not create it.</em>
